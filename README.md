# Insight Actions

Insight Actions is a tool to view attributes, skills, and corresponding actions within the Insight Fantasy RPG. After inputting values into the tool, it helps you identify or search for actions that are relevant for your character to perform, and provides info specific to your character on how you will roll to attempt to perform that action. It is meant to be an aid on top of a character sheet and the book.

## Installation and Usage

It is just an index.html file to host/open directly, and it stores data locally in local storage or for import/export to JSON. It is also hosted online at https://mckennapsean.github.io/insight-actions
